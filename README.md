# Advent of Code 2025

My solutions for Advent of Code 2025 programming challenges.

My goal for this is to solve the problems myself, using code completion and inline Copilot as needed.
After a solution is reached, using Claude to further develop or optimize the solution.

Part of the second step involves exercises perhaps unrelated to Advent Of Code just to practice, like developing this README.

## Solutions

| Day | Title | Description | Solution |
|-----|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | [Secret Entrance](./Day1/README.md) | Circular position tracking with zero crossing optimization | [day1.py](./Day1/day1.py) |
| 2 | TBD | _Coming soon..._ | |
| 3 | TBD | _Coming soon..._ | |

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run any day's solution
python Day1/day1.py [input_file]
python Day2/day2.py [input_file]
# etc.
```

### Development Setup

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.10+
- Black formatter (optional, for code formatting)

**Recommended VS Code Extensions:**
- Python
- Black Formatter

### Project Structure
